This document explains how I debugged the Movie App I built for my React Hook checkpoint using React Developer Tools.

Debugging Steps
1. Finding the Issue:

I noticed that some movie data wasn’t displaying correctly in the MovieCard component. The console showed a warning that the movie prop was missing.
Inspecting with React Developer Tools:

I opened React Developer Tools and looked at the Components panel.
After clicking on MovieCard, I saw that the movie prop was undefined, which was likely causing the missing data issue.
2. Fixing the Issue:

I went to App.js to check where MovieCard was rendered and realized I hadn’t passed the movie prop when mapping through movies.
I updated the code to pass the movie prop to MovieCard.
Fixed Code:

{movies.map((movie, index) => (
  <MovieCard key={index} movie={movie} />
))}
3. Confirming the Fix:

After the change, I rechecked the app in React DevTools and saw that the movie prop was now correctly passed.
I tested the app to ensure movies were displaying as expected and that filtering worked correctly.
